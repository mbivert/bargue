much though.

# Introduction
This repository contains the source code and resources used to
build [bargue.mbivert.com][bargue.mbivert.com]. The latter is
an online collection of plates from [Charles Bargue][wp-en-bargue]'s
[Drawing course][archive-bargue], that I'll progressively comment
so as to help guide people wishing to go through the course.

Good quality reproductions of the plates, from original lithographies,
have recently been collected in a book by Gerald M. Ackerman
(ISBN-13: 978-1788840446).

**<u>Note:</u>** Be careful of cheaper books you may find on Amazon,
many seems to have been grossly crafted using Ackerman's book, and are
a of poor quality.

The images used here were scanned by someone (not me) from the book.
They are a bit grainy, but still quite decent as a cheap alternative to
the book: I've saw way lower-quality scans online.

Another good quality of digital reproductions is
[bargueplate.supply][bargueplate.supply], which also sells print (haven't
tried them yet). If you can afford it,
[Signus Publishing / Bargue Encore (fineartlithography.com)][signus-publishing] sells
[*lithographs*][wp-en-lithography] manufactured as closely as possible
as the original Bargue plates (size, color, overall quality, etc.).

See [this series of articles][tales-bargue] for more about Bargue's course.
